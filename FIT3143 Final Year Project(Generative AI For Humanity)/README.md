To achieve the desired output, users need to follow a specific sequence of four steps. In total, four cells need to run to obtain the output. The users will not be required to download or install any files or system library throughout the entire process. To run each step the users only need to click on the run button on each corresponding cell. For example, to run step 1, the users will only need to press Shift + Enter on their keyboard or click the play button (â–¶) shown in figure 1.
